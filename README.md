De Bruijn Graph-Based Sequence Analysis
This Python script performs sequence analysis using a custom de Bruijn graph implementation. The script is designed to process single-end reads from FASTA or FASTQ files, filter reads based on read abundance, and output the filtered reads to a new file.

Features
Custom de Bruijn graph construction and traversal
Read filtering based on read abundance
Support for FASTA and FASTQ input files
Multi-core parallel processing using Python's multiprocessing module
Requirements
Python 3.x
Biopython
NumPy
Install the required packages using pip:
pip install biopython numpy

Usage
Input Files: Place your input FASTA or FASTQ file in the same directory as the script or provide the full path to the file.

Parameters: Modify the parameters in the if __name__ == "__main__": block of the script as needed:

input_file: Path to the input FASTA or FASTQ file.
output_file: Path to the output file where filtered reads will be saved.
base: Base for log calculation (default is 10).
kmer_size: Size of the k-mer used for de Bruijn graph construction (default is 31).
seq_type: Input sequence type ("fasta" or "fastq").
nodeit: A dictionary or data structure containing node information for read abundance.
Run the Script: Execute the script using the following command:
python script_name.py
Output: The script will generate an output file containing the filtered reads based on read abundance.
Customization
You can modify the generate_kmers, construct_debruijn_graph, traverse_debruijn_graph, calculate_quality, and read_acceptance functions to customize the de Bruijn graph construction and read filtering algorithms according to your specific requirements.
Performance Optimization
The script utilizes multi-core parallel processing to enhance performance by processing reads in parallel.
The custom de Bruijn graph implementation aims to efficiently handle large datasets without relying on external libraries.
